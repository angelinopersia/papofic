### Papofic lets its users save time with a variety of document templates of which the general content is already written.

### Only the necessary variable information must be typed in by the user.

</div>

<br />

**Papofic acts like a basic word processing software online. The user chooses a nearly-completed template among the available ones and fills the given text fields with information.**

**Each document also has its own themes which can be selected to change the model's appearance.**

**Once the process is complete, the document can be saved as a PDF file and/or printed.**
