### Papofic lets French\* users save time with a variety of document templates of which the general content is already written. Only the necessary variable information must be typed in by the user.

</div>

<br />

**Papofic acts like a basic word processing software online. The user chooses a nearly-completed template among the available ones and fills the given text fields with information.**

**Each document also has its own themes which can be selected to change the model's appearance.**

**Once the process is complete, the document can be saved as a PDF file and/or printed.**

\* _Papofic only supports French localization as of today. It is not yet (and will likely never be) planned to support other languages in the future._

#### \* Your contribution is compatible if:

- The content of the pull request does not change the project's code in any other way than by strictly following the [README file regarding themes](https://github.com/angelinopersia/papofic/tree/readMe/src/themes).
