### Papofic lets French\* users save time with a variety of document templates of which the general content is already written. Only the necessary variable information must be typed in by the user.

</div>

<br />

**Papofic acts like a basic word processing software online. The user chooses a nearly-completed template among the available ones and fills the given text fields with their information.**
**Each template also has its own themes which can be selected to change the model's appearance.**
**Once the process is complete, the document can be saved as a pdf file and/or printed.**

\* _Papofic only supports French localization as of today. It is not yet (and will likely never be) planned to support other languages in the future._

## How you can contribute

### Model themes

There are multiple themes already available, but you may create a theme of your own and offer to have it added in the project through a pull request. If the theme is up to certain standards, it will be merged into the project.

#### Your contribution is compatible if:

- The content of the pull request does not change the project's code in any other way than adding and associating your theme to the parts of the project which are related to the themes, and adding your theme into the `themes` folder (A detailed explanation on how to add a theme is available in another readme file within the `themes` folder).
- The names of the variables and file are up to standard according to (other readme).
- No part of your contribution contains offensive content or slurs in any way.
- The CSS is flexible enough, and obviously, doesn't look too bad!

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, please [report it by opening an issue](https://github.com/angelinopersia/papofic/issues/new)!
