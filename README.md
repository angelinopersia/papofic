[# PAPOFIC](http://localhost:3000/)

### Papofic lets French\* users choose a template of a document among many others available and only have to fill in their information. Smooth and easy.

<br />
* Papofic only supports French localization as of today. It is not yet (and will likely never be) planned to support other languages in the future.
