### Papofic lets French\* users choose a template of a document among many others available and only have to fill in their information. Smooth and easy.

</div>

<br />

**Papofic does the basic job of a word processing software and saves you the time and effort needed into thinking up the document's content. The document is already written, not counting the variable information such as your name and the destination's address.**

**All that you are required to do is choose an existing document and fill in the information fields. You can also choose an existing theme if you wish to decorate your document.**

**Once you're done, you may either save it as a pdf file or print it. Or both.**

\* _Papofic only supports French localization as of today. It is not yet (and will likely never be) planned to support other languages in the future._

## How you can contribute

### Template themes

There is a number of themes available from the start, but you may create a theme of your own and offer to have it added in the project through a pull request. If the theme is up to standards, it will be merged into the project.

#### Your contribution is compatible if:

- The content of the pull request does not change the project's code in any other way than adding and associating your theme to the parts of the project which are related to the themes, and adding your theme into the `themes` folder (A detailed explanation on how to add a theme is available in another readme file within the `themes` folder).
- The names of the variables and file are up to standard according to (other readme).
- No part of your contribution contains offensive content or slurs in any way.
- The CSS is flexible enough, and obviously, doesn't look too bad!
