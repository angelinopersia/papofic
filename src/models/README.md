# Model naming process

The name of the model is separated into several parts, namely:

**1. Type of document**

To determine if the document is a letter, a bill, an estimate...

**2. Motive/Goal**

Depending on the type of document, the motive must be precised as well. It could be resignation, cancellation...

**3. Number**

Multiple variants of a model (same type of document and same motive/goal) may exist. The number will differentiate them.

---

Each one of those parts (excluding the number), have their initials concatenated together in the same order.

e.g.:

1. Type of document: **Letter (L)**

2. Motive/Goal: **Cancellation (C)**

3. Number: **000** (Depending on the amount of existing models of the same kind)

_Result: LC000_
